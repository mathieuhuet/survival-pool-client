# Survival-Pool

## Getting Started

To install the required dependencies, you're gonna run `npm install` at the root of the project.

Start the client side with `npm start`

This app can't work properly if you're not running [the Survival-Pool-Server](https://github.com/mathieuhuet/survival-pool-server), don't forget to point the App toward [the Survival-Pool-Server](https://github.com/mathieuhuet/survival-pool-server) IP and port.

You need to create a `secret.js` file int the `src` folder of the project that export these variables : `USER_API`
